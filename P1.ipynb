    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "# MY REFLECTIONS:\n",
    "\n",
    "This first project was lots of fun.. so I look forward to the next ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "I describe shortly how my solution is implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole logic is encapsulated into one single method: `find_lanes_in_image`. This method takes as input an array representation of an image and returns the same image with left and right lanes drawn on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline implementad operates as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: \n",
    "First the color scale of the image is transformed to gray scale which will ease the detection of lines of any color in a future step. After that noise and details are reduced by using Gaussian smoothing. At this point the image going through the pipelines looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"./Reflections/blured.jpg\" width=\"380\" alt=\"GrayBlurred\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2:\n",
    "Then, Canny Edge detection is applied to the image in gray scale to detect all edges. The idea behind this is that the gradient is used to see how fast pixels change in different areas of the image and in which direction they change most rapidly. On top of that, we would like to filter the areas on which we will work on for the rest of the pipeline because we know in which area of the image our lanes will show up. So we mask all we've done so far. The result looks then like:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"./Reflections/canny_masked.jpg\" width=\"380\" alt=\"Canny\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3:\n",
    "Now, a very nice trick is applied for detecting straight lines out of edges: Hough transformation. The Hough transformation takes all edge points to a different space to try to find the parameters $m$ and $b$ that fine lines of the form: $y = m*x + b$. As a result we obtain end points of lines that we can use to infer left and right lanes. At this stage of the pipeline, the processed image looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"./Reflections/hough.jpg\" width=\"380\" alt=\"Canny\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4:\n",
    "You see that we have a bunch of lines. Somehow we have to make sense out of them and try to figure out where exactly our left and right lanes are. For this, all line segment are processed using the following huristic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, each line segment either has posstive or negative slope. If the slope is negative, then the segment is probably part of the left lane. Otherwise, part of the right lane. During this categorization all those lines with slope within the range $[-0.2, 0.2]$ are excluded. If you think about it, it is highly unlikely that a lane with slope 0.1 (almost 0, in other words, a horizontal line) would be a lane our car should follow.\n",
    "* Second, for each left and right lane, average quantities are computed: slope and mean-point.\n",
    "* Given the avg. slope and avg. point, we can find exactly the two endpoints that we need to draw the each lane. We know the min and max y for each of the desired endpoints (y max being the edge of the image itself and y min being the minimum y that contributed to the average point) so we can use the formulas $x_{min} = (y_{min} - y_{avg})/m_{avg} + x_{avg}$ and $x_{max} = (y_{max} - y_{avg})/m_{avg} + x_{avg}$.\n",
    "* For the case on which we are processing an stream of images (a video for example) we take endpoints for each lane and average them with the endpoints we saw from the previous image frame. The purpose of this is to smooth drastic changes from frame to frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is one straight line for each lane:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"./Reflections/lanes.jpg\" width=\"380\" alt=\"Lanes\" />\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5:\n",
    "Finally we need to merge original image with our resulting lanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    " <img src=\"./Reflections/merged.jpg\" width=\"380\" alt=\"Result\" />\n",

    "\n",
    "### Current implementation limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly this implementation fails on the video challenge and these are my thoughts on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The current strategy of converting the original image to a gray scale might not be the best one when there are for example big shadows or other kind of noise that affect brightness directly. Probably another color space would be more tolerant to this situations. I see people mentioning on the forums that a good alternative would be to use HSL or HSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Within the pipeline I use a fixed ROI ( Region of Interest ), which might not be the best for when the car starts to approach curves or for when there are median strips within the ROI. As well, it might be that in order to have the camara capture proximate portions of lanes it would capture as well a good portion of the car itself needing a adjustment of the ROI. A good thing to try here would be to dinamically select a good ROI within the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I am not sure how the algorithm would react if there is another car within the ROI. Probably the number of lines detected would increase dramatically ( given the rectangular shapes of cars ). In this case a better heuristic to discriminate lines that dont form part of a lane would be needed. A starting point would be to ignore line segments that are too steep ( aproximately vertical lines ).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The smoothing mechanism can defenitely be improved. At the moment I am just keeping the coordinates of previous endpoints the algorithm found, which is rather simplistic. Not sure what the best approach would be but probably extending the amount of points kept as history plus a regularized update for current positions might be a good start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some scenarios on which I am completly sure my algorithm would miserably fail:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When driving on roads without marked lanes. In my country, when you find yourself in the country side usually you drive on roads that have no lanes. I think that in this case a broader ROI is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you find yourself on a traffic jam the car in front of you blocks your camera from **seing** the lanes. Probably the car in this case **pays attention to other sensors(?)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When driving backwards :).\n"
